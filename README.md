# LFM Dual-Anchor Spigot – Private Prototype Repository

**Repository Visibility:** Private  
**Status:** Closed-source / Licensing & Collaboration Only  
**Author:** Keith Luton (@lutonfieldmodel)  
**Version:** v3.0 (February 2026)  
**License:** Proprietary – All Rights Reserved. No public use, fork, or redistribution permitted without explicit written permission.

## Overview

This private repository contains the **LFM predictor v3.0**, the core computational engine of the Luton Field Model (LFM).

 derives — with no free parameters — many fundamental constants and physical behaviors:

- Fine structure constant inverse (α⁻¹ ≈ 137.036)  
- Proton-to-electron mass ratio (μ ≈ 1836.118)  
- Neutrino cosmic scale (k_ν ≈ 190.5)  
- AGI-style cognitive mode mapping (deterministic ↔ creative fluidity/retention)  
- Optimization sweet spot at k=70 (≈47.5% efficiency gain)  
- Complete scale mapping from Planck (k=0) to cosmological (k≈204)  
- EM spectrum reader (energy ↔ wavelength ↔ k ↔ dressed/leaked mode)  
- Pressure, length, energy density, force types, phenomena labels, etc.


## Important – This Code Is Not Publicly Available

The full implementation is **proprietary** and **not open-source**.  
No public use, modification, redistribution, or commercial application is allowed without explicit written agreement.

### Current Public Activity
- Daily predictions are being posted on X (@lutonfieldmodel) to demonstrate the model's predictive power  
- A **$50,000 USD bounty** is offered **per prediction** to the first person/team that publishes reproducible, peer-reviewed experimental evidence that **directly falsifies** the core LFM mechanism stated in that prediction  
- The * code itself** is **not** part of the bounty or public challenge

### Licensing & Collaboration Inquiries
If you are interested in:

- Academic / research license  
- Commercial / non-exclusive license  
- Exclusive / strategic licensing  
- Consulting or custom implementation support  
- Collaboration on experimental validation  

please contact directly:  
📧 keith@lutonfield.org  
or DM @lutonfieldmodel on X

Serious inquiries only — please include your affiliation, intended use case, and relevant background.

### Bounty Rules – $50,000 per Prediction
- **Amount:** $50,000 USD (or crypto equivalent) per successfully disproven prediction  
- **Scope:** Applies only to the specific mechanisms stated in each numbered public prediction post on X  
- **Proof standard:** Published, reproducible experimental evidence (peer-reviewed journal strongly preferred; strong arXiv preprint + independent replication may be considered) that directly contradicts the core LFM mechanism  
- **Not sufficient:**  
  - Null results ("we didn't see it")  
  - Theoretical counter-arguments without experiment  
  - Disproof of unrelated side claims  
- **Time window:** 12 months from the date of each prediction post (extendable at author's discretion)  
- **Adjudication:** Good-faith review by the author (or mutually agreed third party if disputed)  
- **Claim process:** Submit evidence via DM or email → review → public announcement if awarded  
- Full terms are pinned on the @lutonfieldmodel X profile

## Repository Contents 
New predictions everyday

## Why Private?

The LFM framework is being positioned as a **high-value computational tool** with potential applications in:

- Materials discovery (room-temperature superconductivity, ultra-high-temp ceramics)  
- Quantum simulation & computing  
- Plasma control & fusion stability  
- Next-generation AGI architectures  
- Cosmology & neutrino physics  

Public release at this stage would undermine the ability to protect and fairly monetize the intellectual property while the model is being validated through public prediction challenges.

## Stay Updated

Follow @lutonfieldmodel on X for:

- Daily prediction posts (with active $50k bounties)  
- Experimental updates  
- Licensing & collaboration announcements  

Serious researchers, laboratories, companies, or investors interested in exploring the full engine are encouraged to reach out directly.

Thank you for respecting the private nature of this work.
